A secret  messages site that converts any entered text into an encryted message.

JSON File used: methods.json contains the ID, Name, and description of the different encryption methods, and loads in asynchronously.
GSAP Animation: Split text animation added to the description of each encryption method. 

this is the link for the website as hosted on github: https://smansi-17.github.io/Secret-Messages/ 

But, I am running into a GSAP Error of an old version of Plugin I used in VS Code. I used the GSAP Snippets extension by Hridoy on VS Code extensions.
